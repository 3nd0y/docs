[Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) is a JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine.

With the [TTN Client](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ttn) you can receive activations and uplink messages from devices via The Things Network as well as respond with downlink messages.

> This guide has been updated for the upcoming version 2.0.0 of the Node.js client and the production backend, which are both currently in preview. Get 2.0.0 via the refactor tag:
>
> ```bash
> npm install --save ttn@refactor
> ```
