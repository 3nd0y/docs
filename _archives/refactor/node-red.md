[Node-RED](http://nodered.org/) is a free, JavaScript-based server and web GUI for wiring together hardware devices, APIs and online services.

With the [Node-RED node for TTN](http://flows.nodered.org/node/node-red-contrib-ttn) it is very easy to process device messages and activations with pretty much no code.

> This guide has been updated for the upcoming version 1.0.0 of the TTN node and the production backend, which are currently both in preview. Get 1.0.0 via the refactor tag:
>
> ```bash
> npm install node-red-contrib-ttn@refactor
> ```
