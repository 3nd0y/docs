# Configure
To use the TTN node you need to configure it for your The Things Network Application.

## Lookup your application info

1.  Open [The Things Network Dashboard](https://preview.dashboard.thethingsnetwork.org/) a new window.
2.  Select the application you'd like to connect to.

## Edit the TTN node

1.  In Node-RED, drag a **ttn** node from the input category in the toolbox on the left to your workflow.
2.  Double click the node to edit it.

    Copy-paste the following information from the dashboard:

    * For **App ID**, copy **Application ID** from the **Application Overview** box.
    * For **Access Key**, scroll down to the **Access Keys**. For the key you'd like to use, click üëÅ to show the key and then üìã to copy it.
    * For **Region or Broker**, scroll back again to use **Handler Status** from the **Application Overview** box. Only copy the last bit following `ttn-handler-`.

    In the terminal you should see something like:
