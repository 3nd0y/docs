# Quick Start
This guide will walk you through setting up a Node.js project that listens to device activations and messages and responds to every 3rd message.

> In a hurry? Skip to [Connect](#connect) to get your application **region**, **Application ID** and **Access Key** and then jump to the [Live Example](#live-example) to run the script we'll write here directly in your browser!

## Setup
Let's install Node.js, create a Node.js project and install the TTN Client.

1.  [Download](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) and install Node.js.
2.  Create a new Node.js project:

    ```bash
    cd $HOME
    mkdir app
    cd app
    npm init
    ```

    > Just press return to accept the default answer to any question asked.

3.  Install and save the [TTN Client](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ttn) as dependency using the refactor tag:

    ```bash
    npm install --save ttn@refactor
    ```

## Connect
Next, we will write the script that requires the TTN Client module and uses it to connect.

1.  Create the main script and open it in your favorite editor:

    ```bash
    touch index.js
    open index.js
    ```

2.  Require the TTN Client module:

    ```js
    var ttn = require('ttn');
    ```

3.  In the [dashboard](https://preview.dashboard.thethingsnetwork.org/applications), navigate to the application you'd like to connect to.

5.  In the editor, create an instance of the client:

    ```js 
    var region = 'eu';
    var appId = 'hello-world';
    var accessKey = '2Z+MU0T5xZCaqsD0bPqOhzA6iygGFoi4FAgMFgBfXSo=';
    
    var client = new ttn.Client(region, appId, accessKey);
    ```

    Here's where you can find the values in the dashboard:
    
    * For `region`, copy the part following `ttn-handler-` for **Handler Status** in the **Application Overview** box.
    * For `appId`, copy the value for **Application ID** in the **Application Overview** box.
    * For `accessKey`, scroll down and then show and copy the value for **default key** in the **Access Key** box.

6.  Add a listener for the `connect` and `error` events to test the connection:

    ```js 
    client.on('connect', function(connack) {
        console.log('[DEBUG]', 'Connect:', connack);
    });
    
    client.on('error', function(err) {
        console.error('[ERROR]', err.message);
    });
    ```
 
7.  Run the script to test the connection:

    ```bash
    node .
    ```

    You should see something like:

    ```bash
    [DEBUG] Connect: Packet {
      cmd: 'connack',
      retain: false,
      qos: 0,
      dup: false,
      length: 2,
      topic: null,
      payload: null,
      sessionPresent: false,
      returnCode: 0 }
    ```

    Use `Ctrl + C` to terminate the script.

    If you get an error it should say what is wrong:

    ```bash
    [ERROR] Connection refused: Not authorized
    ```

    > Make sure you have used the **Application ID** and not an **Application EUI** like version 1.x of the client.

## Receive Activations
Now that we are connected, let's listen for new device activations.

> Be aware that you will only receive `activation` events since the moment the script connects.

1.  Add a listener for the `activation` event:

    ```js
    client.on('activation', function(data) {
        console.log('[INFO] ', 'Activation:', data);
    });
    ```

2.  Run the script again:

    ```bash
    node .
    ```

3.  Power up, reset or upload a new sketch to a device to force it to activate and you should see something like:

    ```bash
    [INFO]  Activation: { dev_id: 'my-uno',
      app_id: 'hello-world',
      app_eui: '70B3D57EF000001C',
      dev_eui: '0004A30B001B7AD2',
      dev_addr: '2601205D',
      metadata:
       { time: '2016-09-08T13:57:03.415027706Z',
         frequency: 868.1,
         modulation: 'LORA',
         data_rate: 'SF7BW125',
         coding_rate: '4/5',
         gateways: [ [Object] ] } }
    ```

    Use `Ctrl + C` to terminate the script.    

## Receive Messages
Now let's listen for actual messages coming in from devices.

I use the same script as [The Things Uno Quick Start](/uno/#quick-start), which both sends and receives messages.

1.  Add a listener for the `message ` event:

    ```js
    client.on('message', function(data) {
        console.info('[INFO] ', 'Message:', JSON.stringify(data, null, 2));
    });
    ```

2.  Run the script again:

    ```bash
    node .
    ```

    If you uploaded the Quick Start sketch you should see something like:

    ```bash
    [INFO]  Message: {
      "dev_id": "my-uno",
      "app_id": "hello-world",
      "port": 1,
      "counter": 0,
      "payload_raw": "SGVsbG8=",
      "payload_fields": {
        "message": "Hello"
      },
      "metadata": {
        "time": "2016-09-08T13:57:08.685529132Z",
        "frequency": 868.3,
        "modulation": "LORA",
        "data_rate": "SF7BW125",
        "coding_rate": "4/5",
        "gateways": [
          {
            "eui": "B827EBFFFE87BD22",
            "timestamp": 1064899219,
            "time": "2016-09-08T13:57:08.673927Z",
            "channel": 1,
            "rssi": -54,
            "snr": 8.2,
            "rf_chain": 1
          }
        ]
      }
    }
    ```

## Send Messages
To send a message you will have to address a specific device by its **Device ID**. Devices will only receive the last (downlink) message send to them in response to the next (uplink) message they send themselves. So let's send a (downlink) message in response to each 3rd (uplink) message we receive from a device.

Again, I use the same script as [The Things Uno Quick Start](/uno/#quick-start) as it is set up to both send and receives messages.

1.  Follow the [The Things Uno Quick Start](/uno/#quick-start) or upload another sketch to your device which sends messages every few seconds and listens for a response it will then print to `Serial`.

2.  In the Arduino IDE, select **Tools > Serial Monitor** `Ctrl/âŒ˜ + Shift + M` to open the [Serial Monitor](/arduino/#serial-monitor).

3.  In the editor for the script, add another listener for the `uplink` event that responds to every 3rd message:

    ```js
    client.on('message', function(data) {
    
        // respond to every third message
        if (data.counter % 3 === 0) {
            console.log('[DEBUG]', 'Sending');

            var payload = new Buffer('4869', 'hex');
            client.send(data.dev_id, payload, data.port);
        }
    });
    ```

4.  Run the script again:

    ```bash
    node .
    ```

    After each 3rd message the script should output:

    ```
    [DEBUG] Sending
    ```

    In the Serial Montor you should see something like this if you uploaded the Quick Start sketch:

    ```
    Sending: mac tx uncnf 1 with 5 bytes
    Successful transmission. Received 2 bytes
    Received Hi
    ```

Congratulations! Now you know how to send and receive messages from a Node.js script.
