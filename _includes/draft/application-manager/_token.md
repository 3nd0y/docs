# Get an Access Token

To use these APIs you need a JSON Web Access Token with a proper scope. In most cases you'll want to exchange an Application Access Key which you can find in The Things Network Console for such a token.

To do so see the related paragraph of the [Account Server API Reference](/account/#exchanging-an-access-key-for-an-access-token).
