# Hello World

<span class="label label-warning">COMING</span> The current beta boards come unconfigured, without Hello World.

* Make sure you are within range of The Things Gateway or other LoRaWAN Gateway that forwards to The Things Network.
* Use the included Micro-USB cable and any USB power adapter or port to power up The Things Uno.
* Go to `[URL]` and enter the unique code printed on `[LOCATION]` of The Things Uno.
* Give it a minute and you should see your The Things Uno say *Hello*.

No succes? Continue to connect to The Things Uno and use the Arduino IDE Serial Monitor to troubleshoot.
