[Arduino](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Guide/Introduction) is an open-source electronics platform based on easy-to-use hardware and software. It's intended for anyone making interactive projects.

With [The Things Network Library](https://github.com/thethingsnetwork/arduino-library) your Arduino Board can communicate via The Things Network. Currently the library requires the board to feature a [Microchip RN2xx3 module](http://www.microchip.com/design-centers/wireless-connectivity/embedded-wireless/lora-technology) for LoRaWAN.

Both [The Things Uno](/uno) and [The Things Node](/node) are Arduino Boards with LoRaWAN.
