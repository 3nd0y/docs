[Arduino](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Guide/Introduction) is an open-source electronics platform based on easy-to-use hardware and software. It's intended for anyone making interactive projects.

With [The Things Network Library](https://github.com/thethingsnetwork/arduino-library) Arduino Boards can communicate via The Things Network. Both [The Things Uno](/uno) and [The Things Node](/node) are Arduino Boards that include a LoRaWAN module.

> With version 0.17 of the library it now has its [own repository](https://github.com/thethingsnetwork/arduino-library), can be installed via the [Library Manager](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Guide/Libraries#toc3) and has been renamed to `TheThingsNetwork`.

> Currently the library requires boards to feature a [Microchip RN2xx3 module](http://www.microchip.com/design-centers/wireless-connectivity/embedded-wireless/lora-technology) for LoRaWAN.
