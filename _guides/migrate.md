This guide will walk you through migrating applications and devices from [staging.thethingsnetwork.org](https://staging.thethingsnetwork.org/) to [preview.dashboard.thethingsnetwork.org](https://preview.dashboard.thethingsnetwork.org/) which will eventually be `dashboard.thethingsnetwork.org`.

> The migration does not require any immediate change on nodes since the staging router forwards data to both the staging and (preview) production.

> Every component on the dashboard has a small <i class="fa fa-question-circle"></i> icon. Click the icon for more information.
