[Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) is a JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine.

With the [TTN Client](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ttn) you can receive activations and uplink messages from devices via The Things Network as well as respond with downlink messages.

> With version 1.3.2 of the Node.js client it now has its [own repository](https://github.com/thethingsnetwork/node-ttn).
