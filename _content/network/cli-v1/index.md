# The Things Network CLI

> This guide is for version `v1-staging` of the CLI, which works with [staging.thethingsnetwork.org](https://staging.thethingsnetwork.org/). Please migrate to version 2.x for [console.thethingsnetwork.org](https://console.thethingsnetwork.org/) ASAP.

Your Applications and Devices can be managed via The Things Network Dashboard, but you can also use the CLI, if you're into that kind of thing. ðŸ˜Ž
