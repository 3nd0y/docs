# MQTT

> This guide is for version 1.x of the MQTT API at [staging.thethingsnetwork.org](https://staging.thethingsnetwork.org/). Please migrate [console.thethingsnetwork.org](https://console.thethingsnetwork.org/) and use version 2.x of the MQTT API at `<Region>`.thethings.network` ASAP.

[MQTT](http://mqtt.org) is a machine-to-machine (M2M)/"Internet of Things" connectivity protocol. It was designed as an extremely lightweight publish/subscribe messaging transport.

The Things Network uses MQTT to publish device activations and messages, but also allows you to publish a message for a specific device in response.
