# Cayenne Integration

Cayenne myDevicesallows you to quickly design, prototype, and visualize IoT solutions. You can use Cayenne to build a nice-looking dashboard that showcases your data nicely.


# Start building the dashboard

## Change the payload format 

In order to display your content in the Cayenne dashboard, the format of the payload has to be adapted. 

> We need to send extra data for Cayenne to understand what data comes into their dashboard. Before we send the sensor data, we need to define what data is sent. The first byte is the so-called **Channel ID**. The sencond bytes explains the **Data Type** (so Cayenne knows that the data contains temperature values). The latter bytes contain the actualy sensor values.
Please have a look [here](https://mydevices.com/cayenne/docs/#lora-cayenne-low-power-payload) to find more information on the Cayenne Lower Power Protocol (LPP).
 
 
Find **the documentation about how to alter your Arduino sketch to encode data with the Cayenne Lower Power Protocol** (LPP) [here](https://www.thethingsnetwork.org/docs/devices/arduino/api/cayennelpp.html). Examle code: 
```js
TheThingsNetwork ttn(loraSerial, debugSerial, freqPlan);
CayenneLPP lpp(51);

lpp.reset();
lpp.addTemperature(1, 22.5);
lpp.addBarometricPressure(2, 1073.21);
lpp.addGPS(3, 52.37365, 4.88650, 2);

ttn.sendBytes(lpp.getBuffer(), lpp.getSize());
```

After encoding data with the Cayenne Lower Power Protocol, have a look at the console to change the **Payload Formats**
 
* Go to your Application in the [**The Things Network Console**](https://console.thethingsnetwork.org/) and click **Payload Formats**
* Select in the dropdown menu **Cayenne LPP** instead of **Custom**



## Setup your myDevices account

1.  Create an account on [myDevices](https://mydevices.com/)
2.  Log-in and click on **LoRa**

## Add the myDevices Cayenne integration in the Console

1.  Go to your application in the [**Console**](https://console.thethingsnetwork.org/applications) and add the myDevices integration via **Add Integration**

2.  You can find your **Process ID** in the URL of the myDevices dashboard, starting after `/lora/`
3.  Add the integration



## Build your Cayenne dashboard
Click the device on the left side of your dashboard in Cayenne and you data is should be shown right away. After a bit of editing you can make quite some fancy stuff:
