# Quick Start

This guide will walk you through setting up the AWS IoT integration using AWS CloudFormation, sync thing registry, sync thing shadows and work with uplink and downlink messages.

## Setup

1. Log in to the [AWS Management Console](http://console.aws.amazon.com)
2. In **Services** under **Management Tools**, go to **CloudFormation**
3. Click **Create Stack**
4. Under **Choose a template**, select **Specify an AWS S3 template URL** and enter:

   ```
   https://s3.amazonaws.com/thethingsnetwork/builds/integration-aws/dist/cloudformation.template
   ```

   ![Select Template](select-template.png)

5. Click **Next**
6. In the **Specify Details**, configure the integration:

   * Enter a **Stack name**, for example `ttn-app`
   * Enter the **AppID** and an **AppAccessKey** of your application in The Things Network
   * Enter an **EnvironmentName** for Elastic Beanstalk, for example `ttn-app`
   * If you are using a private network, change the **AccountServer** and **DiscoveryServer** to the endpoints of your private network
   * Select an existing EC2 KeyPair in **KeyName** to access the EC2 instance. [Read more](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ec2-key-pairs.html)

   > The **AppAccessKey** that you enter should at least have the `messages` and `devices` rights.

   Example parameters:

7. Click **Next**
8. Leave the **Tags**, **Permissions** and **Advanced** as is, and click **Next** again
9. Review your settings and check the **I acknowledge** box to acknowledge that resources for the integration may be created in your AWS account
10. Click **Create** to initiate the creation of the stack
11. After a coffee break of about six minutes, you will see two new stacks:

    > The `awseb-...` stack is an AWS Elastic Beanstalk stack that is created as part of the stack of the integration process.

ðŸŽ‰ You have now successfully configured the AWS IoT integration! See the guides on the left to learn working with the [thing registry](thing-registry), [test messages](test-messages), [thing shadows](thing-shadows), [act on data](act-on-data), [view metrics](view-metrics) and [update](update) the integration.
