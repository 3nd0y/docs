## The Things Network

+ [The Things Gateway](../gateway): Following a [successful Kickstarter](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/419277966/the-things-network) our own LoRa Gateway will soon be available world-wide. At a price of just â‚¬300 and with its easy web-based setup, it is the best choice to help build The Things Network.

## Laird - RG1xx

Laird RG186 & RG191 - ( https://www.lairdtech.com/products/rg1xx-lora-gateway ) A cost effective 868 / 915MHz LoRa Gateway with dual band Wi-Fi, Ethernet and BT capabilities with integrated presets for simple one click configuration for The Thing Network

## Kerlink

+ [Kerlink IoT Station](../kerlink): The Kerlink IoT Station was one of the first commercially available gateways, running a Linux OS. Although the software is outdated and will required a trained engineer, it is a suitable industrial solution. Our documentation explains how to connect it to The Things Network.

+ [Kerlink iBTS](http://www.kerlink.com/en/products/lora-iot-station-2/wirnet-ibts): The Kerlink iBTS is the successor of the IoT Station. Its hardware and software offer multi-antenna setups, giving more precise device data.

## Multitech

+ [Multitech Conduit](../multitech): The Multitech Conduit offers a very good price/quality compromise. It has recent software, with multiple programmation interface (SDK, Python environment...). It comes in multiple models: AEP, mLinux, cellular...

+ [Multitech Conduit Access Point](http://www.multitech.net/developer/products/multiconnect-conduit-access-point/): The Access Point is the successor of the Multitech Conduit. It is very close to the Conduit, but offers an SPI interface to the LoRa concentrator, whereas the Conduit interfaced through USB.

## Lorrier

+ [Lorrier LR2](../lorrier) is a fully outdoor device intended to establish a wide coverage network by telecommunications operators and local network by individuals or IoT connectivity service providers. Our documentation explains how to connect it to The Things Network.

## Lorix
