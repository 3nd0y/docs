The Things Uno is based off the [Arduino Leonardo](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Guide/ArduinoLeonardoMicro) ([not the Arduino Uno](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Guide/ArduinoLeonardoMicro#toc9)) with added [Microchip LoRaWAN module](http://www.microchip.com/design-centers/wireless-connectivity/embedded-wireless/lora-technology) and a connection for an optional external antenna (with exception of beta boards). It is fully compatible with the [Arduino IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software) and [existing shields](http://shieldlist.org/).

It's the perfect board to start prototyping your IoT ideas or make an existing project wireless with up to 10km range by simply swapping boards.

This guide will walk you through programming The Things Uno to send and receive messages via The Things Network.
