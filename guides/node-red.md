[Node-RED](http://nodered.org/) is a free, JavaScript-based server and web GUI
for wiring together hardware devices, APIs and online services.

With the [Node-RED node for TTN](http://flows.nodered.org/node/node-red-contrib-ttn)
it is very easy to process device messages and activations with pretty much no code.
